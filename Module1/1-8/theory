SDLC->Software Development Lifecycle

1)Requirement Gathering
2)Analysis ->What,How
3)Design->
4)Implementation
5)Testing
6)Maintenance

1)corrective maintenance:finding and correcting defects
2)adaptive maintenance:pass your solution to the new platform and make it more adaptive
3)perfective maintenance:make it perfect and add some new functionalities which is not required

Testing:
testing is a process used to identify correctness,completeness,quality of developed computer software.

error->a mistake which is done by developer in coding
defect-> if that error is found by tester then it's called defect
bug->if defect will accept by developer then it's called bug


Activity:Single Process
Process:Multiple Process

Testing is a process of verification and validation

1) Static Testing : Static Testing means a testing which does not work with code execution

2) Dynamic Testing : You have to execute the code


there is 2 type of requirements
1)Functional requirement
2)NonFunctional requirement

Functional Testing: Parameters
Non Functional Testing : Speed,Performance,Scalability
